# Dijkstra-s-Travel-Planner
Dijkstra's Travel Planner is a C++ application that uses Dijkstra's Algorithm to find the shortest path between cities (nodes) in a simulated map (graph). This project is inspired by real-world GPS navigation systems and demonstrates how graph theory can be applied to solve routing and path optimization problems.
